# bottom-menu-bar-splash-page
Experiment with the essentials of a splash page.

## what makes this layout work
The desktop layout shines.  

### bottom menubar
I like the menu bar at the bottom. Based on mobile adoption trends thats the direction we should go.

### curated fonts
The fonts pair gently together and the headline that should dominate the screen does. The attention flows across the page similar to a well made poster.

### sizing
I've set all of the spacing and sizing to look good to the eye using recommended multiples.

## includes
* Bootstrap and Jarallax for the image parallax effect on scroll
* Specific utility classes for customized aesthetics
